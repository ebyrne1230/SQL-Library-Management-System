# SQL-Library-Management-System


This is a code snippet of a final project during my SQL coursework.

The idea was to be able to create a Library Management System.  

This was meant to Create and build a large scale database that could be used to track and mine data regarding: local library branches,
books, the number of copies, books on loan, their various borrowers, etc.

This code had to include several parts of a sequence.

The first was the creation of the database.  Which included the overall design of the data-tables that would house the library data.

Secondly it would include Insertion statements which essentially allowed for the manually entry of all of the data.

The Third was the structure of queries based on questions that would essentially grab data from the data-tables and present the user with data retrieved from the database.  Hopefully in a useable and meaningful way.
